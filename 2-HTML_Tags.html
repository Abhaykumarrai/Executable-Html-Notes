<!--
*************************** What is Html tags *****************************
-It consists of an opening bracket and a closing bracket.
-Usually consist of reserved keywords that have a unique meaning.
-They cannot be nested

Here's an example of incorrect (non-nested) HTML:

<p>This is an <strong>incorrect</p></strong> example.
In this case, the closing </p> tag comes before the closing </strong> tag, 
which is incorrect because you must close the inner tag (<strong>) before closing the outer one (<p>).
