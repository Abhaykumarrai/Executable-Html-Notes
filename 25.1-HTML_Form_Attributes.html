<!--
-------------------------- form 'action' Attributes ---------------------------------------
-The action attribute defines the action to be performed when the form is submitted.
-Usually, the form data is sent to a file on the server when the user clicks on the submit button.
-In the example below, the form data is sent to a file called "isert_data.php". This file contains a server-side script that handles the form data:


-------------------------- form 'target' Attributes ---------------------------------------
-The target attribute specifies where to display the response that is received after submitting the form.
-The target attribute can have one of the following values:

1-'_blank'	The response is displayed in a new window or tab
2-'_self'	The response is displayed in the current window
3-'_parent'	The response is displayed in the parent frame
4-'_top'	The response is displayed in the full body of the window


-------------------------- form 'method' Attributes ---------------------------------------
-The method attribute specifies the HTTP method to be used when submitting the form data.
-The form-data can be sent as URL variables (with method="get") or as HTTP post transaction (with method="post").
-The default HTTP method when submitting form data is GET.

Notes on GET:

1-Appends the form data to the URL, in name/value pairs
2-NEVER use GET to send sensitive data! (the submitted form data is visible in the URL!)
3-The length of a URL is limited (2048 characters)
4-Useful for form submissions where a user wants to bookmark the result
5-GET is good for non-secure data, like query strings in Google

Notes on POST:

1-Appends the form data inside the body of the HTTP request (the submitted form data is not shown in the URL)
2-POST has no size limitations, and can be used to send large amounts of data.
3-Form submissions with POST cannot be bookmarked



-------------------------- form 'autocomplete' Attributes ---------------------------------------
-The autocomplete attribute specifies whether a form should have autocomplete on or off.
-When autocomplete is on, the browser automatically complete values based on values that the user has entered before.
